      <description>Hamnet follows Agnes, the wife of William Shakespeare, and her family - her brothers, children, in-laws - as well as several of the greater village populous. The book makes very few references to William, and never actually names him. He is always &amp;ldquo;he&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;husband&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;father&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;him&amp;rdquo;. Describing Agnes as &amp;ldquo;the wife&amp;rdquo;, as I did mere sentences ago, serves only as an introduction, and as a drastic under-selling of Agnes.
Set in a 1500s southern England, the book darts between the characters&#39; present - following the life and early death of Hamnet, Agnes&#39; only son - and the years preceding these events: Agnes&#39; childhood, meeting her husband, raising a family.</description>
