      <description>Like anybody who makes interfaces for apps/websites, I spent a lot of time looking at Design Inspiration (read: UIs, real or imaginary, made by other people). This is a really good way to look at visual conventions that other people made, and have used in their UIs and UX.
If I were to examine the time I spent “designing” more closely, and divided it between actually pushing pixels around in Figma, and looking at other people’s work on Dribbble I would be shocked and ashamed.</description>
