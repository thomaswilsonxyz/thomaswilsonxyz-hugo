      <description>Your side-projects deserve a decisive, merciful death at your hands. You dragged them into this world, youâ€™ll fling them out. And do it quickly.
I want to talk about killing our much beloved side-projects, and why this is totally a good idea. Then I want to talk about why this could be a terrible idea. Iâ€™m not here for resolutions.
There are two parts of my personality, plucked from the universe-scale D&amp;amp;D Players Manual, which make the question â€œshould I carry on with this side project?</description>

      <description>Tiny Thoughts are little (&amp;lt;500 word) essays. They&amp;rsquo;re concise.
Hypothesis: Frontend engineering cannot exist in isolation from backend technologies.
What sparked this: Thinking about building the next generation of web software at Oxwash.
All software is either&amp;hellip;
 Used by a human for a human-scale (i.e. nebulous and larger) task like updating a status on social media, download a bank statement, or send a message. Used by other software to complete some computer-scale (i.</description>

      <description>2020 has been a terrible year in so, so many ways for so, so many people. At the very least, the Covid-19 pandemic has stolen a year from us all. I would say most of us have gone through a personal and collective trauma this year.
I do not believe this year will be a turning point for us as a society. I don&amp;rsquo;t think this will be the moment people stopped flying transatlantic for a 2pm lunch meeting in LA.</description>

      <description>Tiny Thoughts are little (&amp;lt;500 word) essays. They&amp;rsquo;re concise.
I make user interfaces, and I often participate in, or lead, the process of designing these interfaces. For a while I thought I wanted to transition fully into a design role. Ultimately I am drawn to the certainty and craft of engineering. However, the the mental models, sensibilities, and philosophies of design still appeal to me. I can like both, and businesses need both.</description>

      <description>Tiny Thoughts are little (&amp;lt;500 word) essays. They&amp;rsquo;re concise.
I&amp;rsquo;ve spent the past three months consciously trying to write and read more. I want to improve my ability to refine and communicate thought, and doing it in public helps motivate me to produce work.
One of the hardest problems I find myself addressing frequently is my desire to over-explain or provide too much information. I have read many times that good writing is about being concise.</description>

      <title>Software Engineering as a Craft</title>

      <description>A few months ago a prominent figure in the tech and software space was uninvited from a conference1. In an (intentionally humorous) summary of this person, Melissa McEwan wrote a Tech Bullshit Explained about the person. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to talk about any of allegations or (tellingly-immature) reactions to the allegations, but something McEwan said in her post didn&amp;rsquo;t seem to fit, and to me seemed a little too far. She says:</description>

      <title>I don&#39;t want to be a unicorn ðŸ¦„, an engineer or a designer - I just want to build things better</title>

      <description>I like building software, or parts of software, which are visual and interactive. I do not particularly enjoy the more abstract, very important, areas like technical optimisation, language design, or anything with the word &amp;ldquo;distributed&amp;rdquo; in it. I like building user interfaces (UIs); but also architecting and engineering the code that underlies these interfaces, so that engineers can build delightful and functional UIs, without going through as much effort. Good UI and user experience (UX) should be a norm, a default.</description>
