      <description>2020 has been a terrible year in so, so many ways for so, so many people. At the very least, the Covid-19 pandemic has stolen a year from us all. I would say most of us have gone through a personal and collective trauma this year.
I do not believe this year will be a turning point for us as a society. I don&amp;rsquo;t think this will be the moment people stopped flying transatlantic for a 2pm lunch meeting in LA.</description>
