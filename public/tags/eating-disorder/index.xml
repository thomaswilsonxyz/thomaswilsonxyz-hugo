      <description>tl;dr - I have moved the writing I have created on my experiences with eating disorders to this site (and off of Medium.). You can find them here.

I find writing helps me clarify my thoughts and my situation to me. While a lot of this writing is intentionally private, there are a couple of piece I want to be publicly available.</description>
