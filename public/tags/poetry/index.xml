      <description>Godden has been writing and performing poetry since she decided to move to London instead of going to university. “Godden is a poet” headlines my review because it is so evident in every page of this book. Every transition from unknown narrator, to fourth-wall breaking direct address, to poetry, to “normal” prose. Godden barely pays attention to consistency when she writes, because she is trying to get across an idea. All books are poor transcriptions of spoken word stories that buoyed humanity through tens of thousands of years, long before we invented written word, paper, and typesetting.</description>
