      <description>(Not) Things I learned this week #38 This week seems to have really flown by. I’ve decided to take purposeful and intentional time for rest and personal recuperation this week. I’m not feeling burned out, but I could certainly smell some distant smoke on the wind. So here’s to taking evenings to get around to those household repairs I’ve been putting off, to that growing pile of unread books. I said 2021 was my Year of Discourse and as we transition from winter to spring, I’m checking in with myself.</description>

      <description>This week I’ve been focusing on perspective and gratitude. It’s harder than it sounds if you feel things are unfair and not in your favour. But, to quote about a million throw cushions on Pinterest: you can’t control life, only how you react to it. So this week I am choosing to react by being grateful. Even if it has to start out feeling like a very pointed lie, or jibe to my less patient self.</description>

      <description>The cold snap in London is teasing us. Is it over? hopefully. But it will still be ~1C at night so don’t get too complacent. Still, the days already feel long. I can hardly remember it being dark at 4pm but I’m sure I’ll remember as soon as October comes. There’s a lot of spring, summer, and autumn between now and then though. Here’s some things I learned this week</description>

      <description>The slightly cold-snap here in London continues. The optimistic sewing and sprouting that took place in my garden (such as it is in urban West London) have largely had to retreat to the comfort of the indoors. Covid-related deaths continue to fall in the UK, as we begin optimistically opening up after a very long winter. I’ve started to have more normal moments - more going into a (socially-distanced) office, going to (socially-distanced) gatherings of people outside of my household.</description>

      <description>Things I Learned #34 We’ve made it to the Easter weekend. Spring has arrived here in London, which is to say it was 20 degrees C earlier this week and this morning it was 0, windy, and overcast. This time a year ago, my mental state was dominated by COVID-19 (something I barely even think about now), but that also lead me to notice the beauty of spring for the first time.</description>

      <description>This cassette revival: Last year&amp;rsquo;s (2020&amp;rsquo;s) sale of tape cassettes, the 90&amp;rsquo;s mainstay of car sound systems and OG Walkmans (Walkmen?) were the highest they have been since 2003. An increase of 94% on 2019. Despite having inferior sound quality to CDs and vinyl, the medium is a lot cheaper and easier to produce which means a lower initial investment and potentially higher profits, which is great for indie musicians.</description>

      <description>Following on from International Women&amp;rsquo;s Day last week, news of Sarah Everard&amp;rsquo;s body being discovered broke on the 10th of March, a week after she went missing from Clapham, London. There have been subsequent vigils (and protests) to remind us all that violent and sexual crimes against women are under-reported and under-convicted, and that any fair and just society needs to build systems that don&amp;rsquo;t let people think (let alone know) that they can hurt or sexually assault another person and probably get away with it.</description>

      <description>This week we celebrated International Women&amp;rsquo;s Day. My love and support goes out to anyone who identifies with that label. Let&amp;rsquo;s keep pushing for fair representation and pay, acknowledgement of domestic labour as work, and maybe some systemic government-backed support for domestic abuse victims and sex workers that doesn&amp;rsquo;t involve the police where it&amp;rsquo;s not necessary. Anyway, here&amp;rsquo;s a funny a bit by Iliza Shlesinger that I love.

      <description>These no longer fictional bridges: You know the bridges on the Euro notes? There are seven of them total (notes and bridges) which represent seven different architectural styles. They were originally designed in 2002 and were (at the time) fictitious bridges which didn&amp;rsquo;t exist anywhere - so that no country felt special or left out. Robin Stam, an architect from the Netherlands, has gone ahead and designed and built them all irl, for cyclists to use.</description>

      <description>This lineage of cats: Chartwell House, in Kent, England, was the home of Winston Churchill. It&amp;rsquo;s now owned and operated by the National Trust, a British institution, allowing visitors to see the gardens and houses. During Churchill&amp;rsquo;s life, he had a marmalade (white and ginger) cat, called Jock. A few months after Chartwell House was handed over to the National Trust by the Churchill family, the family made the request that there always be a marmalade cat with a white bib and four ginger paws.</description>

      <description>This collective noun: If I was to make a list of small-talk and first date conversation topics it would go something like this: food, the tube, podcasts or books, and then collective nouns for animals. How many times have I been told the words &amp;ldquo;a parliament of owls&amp;rdquo; in my life? I don&amp;rsquo;t know, but I love re-remembering every time. This week I learned a new collective noun, and I&amp;rsquo;m sorry if you heard this one already: a scurry of squirrels.</description>

      <description>This seventeenth century petition: In 1674 in England, a pamphlet was made and published, titled The Women&amp;rsquo;s Petition Against Coffee. The women (or alleged women, we don&amp;rsquo;t actually know who wrote this) were fighting against the new trend of coffee houses in London, which had arrived some time in the 1650s. These proto-cafés became political and intellectual hubs in London, just as they had in other parts of the world, where men would meet and discuss all sorts of dangerous things like politics and science.</description>

      <description>This heartening fact: Altruism, more specifically altruistic behaviour, is an action done (at cost) by an individual for the benefit of another individual. Why do humans, and other social animals, engage in altruistic behaviour? How does it makes sense on the evolutionary balance sheets? There is increasing evidence that altruism is an evolved, or more specifically phylogenetic, behaviour and that it is not learned. As social creatures, humans have an innate ability to empathise with each other.</description>

      <description>This etymology: The word &amp;ldquo;peculiar&amp;rdquo; has come to mean odd or unique, so obviously its Latin root word (‌peculium) means somebody&amp;rsquo;s cattle. Cows were pretty valuable assets back in the day: you can eat them, milk them, use them as work animals, so they became a symbol of wealth. Later, ‌peculiaris evolved from this same root word to mean &amp;ldquo;of private property&amp;rdquo;, i.e. belonging to one person. This link makes sense too - if cattle are the stereotypical idea of property and wealth, then they&amp;rsquo;ll start to become synonymous.</description>

      <description>This fitness research: I&amp;rsquo;ve long been a fan of interval training to help improve my running and cycling speed. High intensity interval training (HIIT) is a method of training where you mix short bursts of intense activity (e.g. a 30 second sprint) between longer periods of low-intensity exercise (e.g. 90 seconds slow jog). It&amp;rsquo;s time-efficient, evidence-backed, and makes me uncomfortably sweaty so it must be good. Our current guess is that by pushing through into very high intensity activity you trigger different physiological responses, compared to sustained moderate exercise.</description>

      <description>These underwater drawings: Go back to 1860s and ask someone what coral reefs, or fish, or literally any marine life looked like. Go on. I bet they&amp;rsquo;d tell you they had no idea. How would they? Sure, we&amp;rsquo;d been sending people down there since the 1500s in these giant metal bells but those were more function-over-form. You couldn&amp;rsquo;t really see out of them. Around the 1400s we maybe started sending people down with metal crates over their head and tubes attached to their suits to feed air to them.</description>

      <description>This week the UK Government has brought us Lockdown The Third, a threequel in the franchise after the straight-to-TV movie that was the November lockdown. Cases, deaths, and hospital admissions are at an all-time high in our country at the moment, with London in particular looking pretty scary. It might be the &amp;ldquo;the last push&amp;rdquo; like this (boy, I really hope it is the last push), but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t help the healthcare workers being forced forward/backwards/downwards by this whole situation.</description>

      <description>Happy New Year 🎊🥳🍾 It&amp;rsquo;s been one hell of a ride, 2020, and I hope that I never know another year like you. This has been quite enough. We&amp;rsquo;re at least six months from being slightly out of the woods, but we&amp;rsquo;ve made it through nine-to-twelve (depending on where you live) months of surprise pandemic. We can make it through another six. I don&amp;rsquo;t care that 365 days or a rotation around the sun is arbitrary.</description>

      <description>This week&amp;rsquo;s post comes a little lighter, on account of it being Christmas and all. I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to break a streak, but also I want to get back to eating far too much and doing far too little. So let&amp;rsquo;s get on with it:
 This etymology: The word apocalypse comes from the Greek apokaluptein: to uncover, or reveal. This original meaning got adopted in bible translations in the context of revelations - which makes sense.</description>

      <description>All of these species named after David Attenborough: The man&amp;rsquo;s a living legend (he&amp;rsquo;s also like 94 - he was a teenager in the 1930s which was before the second world war - this isn&amp;rsquo;t the fact by the way, this is just some incredible side-facts). The collective scientific community has named over 20 species of animals and plants after him, including Attenborosaurus - the marine dinosaur, Pristimantis attenborough - a Peruvian frog, and Acisoma attenboroughi - a dragonfly.</description>

      <description>I took a four day week last week, so managed to spend this week with all the energy that only a 3-day weekend can give you. That said, I&amp;rsquo;ve found myself incredibly busy this week. This is the first evening (Thursday) where I&amp;rsquo;ve managed to find some time to myself without something pressing. Lockdown continues, Brexit talks and COVID vaccine are competing for media attention, but also I bought two (2!</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s time of year again: Spotify have released their Rewind - showing you what you listened to throughout this year. After the year (or decade, or complete non-year, whatever helps you) that 2020 has been, I think a lot of people have looked to music for a bit of refuge, or good news, or distraction. Go and check yours out, it&amp;rsquo;s a cool little use of data, presented in a really nice way.</description>

      <description>These Tattoos: In the late 1880s, a man called Sutherland Macdonald became the UK&amp;rsquo;s first professioanl tattoo artist. Although he was already an artist, he started the tattoo craft after a trip to the South Pacific. Macdonald is the reason we have the word &amp;lsquo;tattooist&amp;rsquo; (a portmanteau of tattoo and artist) - because the Post Office had to create a new category to place an advert for his services in.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Isn&amp;rsquo;t it getting dark early ?&amp;rdquo; - how I&amp;rsquo;ve started at least half of the conversations I&amp;rsquo;ve had this week.
 This thing that spreads like a disease: Look, I was a germaphobe before it was cool. I was very aware of how one thing can spread from person to person. However this contagious model of disease doesn&amp;rsquo;t just apply to problems caused by bacteria/virus/any other vectors. Obesity can spread like disease, where if your friendships mostly comprise of obese people who normalise a sedentary lifestyle, or poor diet, you&amp;rsquo;re nearly about 170% more likely to be obese than if you weren&amp;rsquo;t in these friendships.</description>

 This Roman Beverage: I&amp;rsquo;d imagine the Romans were pretty thirsty. The Mediterranean is warm, and you&amp;rsquo;d work up quite the thirst inventing a whole number system, apartments, a calendar, and like a million kinds of war machinery. Not that I&amp;rsquo;d know. The Romans bloody loved posca: a mix of vinegar and water (or diluted wine), seasoned with herbs and salt. It was incredibly popular in both the military and with citizenry an.</description>

      <description>WHAT. A. WEEK. It feels the entire western world has had their eyes on the US presidential election, and it&amp;rsquo;s been exhausting. Not exhausting in the way that the last 12 months have been for the US, but exhausting in the way that nothing in 2020 has lead us to expect anything good to happen. As I write this, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris have just been elected as president- and vice president-elect.</description>

      <description>This high fat diet: Whales, like dolphins but also humans, are mammals. This means they feed their young with milk. As you would expect, the blue whale has the largest mammary glands on Earth – each is about 1.5m long and weighs as much as a baby elephant. Blue whale mothers can produce 200 litres of milk per day, with a fat content of 35-50%. For reference, double cream is about 48% fat.</description>

      <description>This thing about how we sleep: In Western Europe, about 35% of young adults sleep with a soft toy every night, and about 44% of people keep hold of their childhood soft toy. It can be especially helpful for people with low self-esteem, or higher anxiety to sleep with a soft toy, apparently. As someone who&amp;rsquo;s kept firm tabs on their childhood bear (though I&amp;rsquo;d say we sleep adjacent, not together), it shocks me that over half of people would throw their teddybear away.</description>

      <description>This Tiny City: St. David&amp;rsquo;s is a city with a population of about 1,000 people. In 1886 it was stripped of its status as a city, being described as &amp;ldquo;lonely, and the neighbouring district wild and unimproved&amp;rdquo;. In 1994 Queen Elizabeth II requested it be restored as a city, and now it is.

      <description>In honour of the announcement of (some of) the 2020 Nobel Prizes, this week&amp;rsquo;s edition contains entirely things I learned when reading about the people and work announced so far. Note that this doesn&amp;rsquo;t include anything about the Peace or Economics prizes, which had not been announced at the time of writing.
I also started a new job this week so I&amp;rsquo;m running at 5-10% mental capacity so we&amp;rsquo;re in for another short edition this week!</description>

      <description>This week&amp;rsquo;s Things I learned is a little shorter than usual because I&amp;rsquo;ve been moving house. I hate every part of moving house. Anyway, enough excuses, here are some of the things I learned this week:
 This thing about reading: I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about how much we read recently. I think we&amp;rsquo;d all like to read more, and you hear so often of speed readers who can devour books in hours.</description>

      <description>This unknown origin: No one is quite certain where the term &amp;ldquo;rule of thumb&amp;rdquo; came from. It has been mistakenly attributed to a British Judge&amp;rsquo;s rule that a man can beat his wife if the stick so long as it is less wide than his thumb, however there&amp;rsquo;s no evidence to support that this ruling was ever made. (source) This heist: The police recently seized about £2.5m worth of books which were originally stolen in 2017.</description>

      <description>These ways of thinking: When we hand over a new problem to our brain there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of things we need to do to solve it. We need to understand the problem and the surrounding/causal concepts as well as the constraints on a solution. For example the challenge might be &amp;ldquo;what should I write about on my blog this week?&amp;rdquo;, and a constraint might be that it a) can&amp;rsquo;t be boring, and b) can&amp;rsquo;t be too long.</description>

      <description>This missed opportunity to name something: Ping Pong is a weird name for a sport, right? Ping Pong is actually a trademarked name, but it&amp;rsquo;s not uncommon to call a thing by a brand name: it&amp;rsquo;s like Hoover vs. Vacuum Cleaner, or Kleenex vs. Tissue. The real-fun fact here is that in 1900 Slazenger, a sports company, filed a trademark for the term Whiff-Waff - and 120 years laters (somehow) Ping Pong prevailed while Whiff-Waff died out, despite the fact that it&amp;rsquo;s clearly more joyful.</description>

      <description>This world: The Word Kipple is a word invented by SciFi writer Phillip K. Dick, to mean the kind of rubbish/trash that accumulates if humans don&amp;rsquo;t intervene. source This part of our brain: You know when you suddenly remember that you need to reply to that e-mail, drop off that parcel, or pick up eggs before dinner? That&amp;rsquo;s your prospective memory - which is kind of the opposite of your normal memory (your retrospective memory) because it &amp;ldquo;remembers&amp;rdquo; things which need to happen in the future.</description>

      <description>This medieval lingo: Have you ever wondered how to refer to the area where a good-old-fashioned joust took place? You know, jousts? Two men, two horses, two giant poles, and one film where Heath Ledger is irresponsibly handsome? Sorry, I got distracted there - did you know the area where the jousts took places is called a List, and the fence that separated the two riders is called the Tilt (source).</description>

      <description>This useful thinking tool: good writing starts with observations, and moves to analysis. Making the transition is difficult. One way to spot a mental crutch is to see where you reach for words like &amp;ldquo;interestingly&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;surprisingly&amp;rdquo;, or &amp;ldquo;notably&amp;rdquo;. These all hint at a significance or meaningfulness, but don&amp;rsquo;t actually clarify it. (source) This hot takeaway: Did you know that during the 1970s if you ordered a takeaway coffee it came in a styrofoam cup and a lid without a hole.</description>

      <description>This tidbit about a literary villa: Over three days in June of 1816 at a villa in Geneva, Mary Shelley started writing Frankenstein, or The Modern Prometheus and John William Polidori started The Vampyre (which preceded the modern romantic image of vampires). The latter inspired Lord Byron (who was also at the villa, by the way) to write A Fragment. Imagine being 2am whiskey drunk at that, wow. This way to think about css/styling: The decisions we make about the naming, structure, and languages/frameworks for modern styling tools just move complexity, they don’t solve it.</description>
