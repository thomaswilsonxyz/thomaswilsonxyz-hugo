			<p>I&rsquo;m building DashDot: a privacy-focused interval training app that doesn&rsquo;t suck. The second cycle of development lasted March 15 - April 12. Let&rsquo;s look at where we are.</p>
<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>
<p>Here are the things I wanted to achieve in this cycle:</p>
<ol>
<li>‚úÖ Finalise the code architecture and restore tests</li>
<li>‚úÖ Allow someone to complete a (timed) timer</li>
<li>‚úÖ Focus on the persistence of timers and workouts. Make sure that relationships between these entities are persisted.</li>
<li>‚úÖ Buy domain names (for app and company)</li>
<li>‚úÖ Decide on ticketing / management software and method. JIRA vs. Linear</li>
<li>‚úçÔ∏è Solidify and scale-back the UI design</li>
<li>üôÖ Make the UI nice</li>
<li>üôÖ Continue with TDD and high test coverage</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="designing-code-architecture">Designing Code Architecture</h2>
<p>This cycle I started running into the limitations and assumptions of my previous software architecture. Four weeks ago I did not have any strong opinions or experience on architecture for a SwiftUI app, but now I do. I wrote about my experience with this <a href="/blog/2021-04-08-just-enough-software-design">pretty extensively</a> elsewhere. In summary, I&rsquo;ve taken a very Rails-esque approach to the design: splitting my software into models, views, view models, and interfaces. Dividing by function rather than domain model will make some people mad, but it&rsquo;s actually really helped keep everything clear in my head.</p>
<p>I ended up doing a pretty major refactoring of the architecture, which mean that a lot of my previously-written tests were no longer useful, and had to be deleted. I was only attached to them via the sunk-cost fallacy, so away they went.</p>
<p>I also got to draw some pretty gnarly, sprawling UML-style diagrams in this process to help me really flesh out my thinking. That was cool.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve still not reached the same level of test coverage as I had before, but I <em>do</em> have a much more readable and consistent code architecture so I think the pros outweigh the cons.</p>
<h2 id="allow-someone-to-complete-a-timer">Allow someone to complete a timer</h2>
<p>Creating a timer and doing a workout are the two core workflows in DashDot. This cycle I focused on that user journey: letting someone select a timer they wanted to complete and then start doing it.</p>
<p>There are a couple of complications here (obviously) but this workflow now functions. In DashDot you can now select a pre-existing timer, and start <em>doing</em> it. The app will persist your progress and process as you go, and progress you through the intervals, etc.</p>
<p>So far you can only complete timed intervals (not distance). That&rsquo;ll be one of two focus points for Cycle#02.</p>
<h2 id="persistence-and-relationships">Persistence and relationships</h2>
<p>I spent a good few days really getting into CoreData, managed object contexts, and the ORM-like way of managing relationships between entities.</p>
<p>DashDot now persists records of your activities, your workouts, and your timers - all without any fuss. This is an essential feature and I&rsquo;m glad it&rsquo;s done</p>
<p>I have created an Active Record-like pattern for my business entities, as I didn&rsquo;t like the idea of manually modifying the generated classes from CoreData. This allows me to have some helper methods on my models to access related data, and to treat what&rsquo;s in the persisted CoreData layer as DTOs. This is definitely my web influence coming through: treating the data persistence as dumb and largely stateless objects. I&rsquo;m not sure if this is the best, or most Swifty, way of doing things - but it&rsquo;s the way that lets me move faster.</p>
<h2 id="purchase-domain-names">Purchase domain names</h2>
<p>I needed domain names for both the app and for the company I&rsquo;d be publishing it under. I&rsquo;ve purchased both of those and I&rsquo;ll share when there&rsquo;s actually something on them.</p>
<h2 id="project-management-jira--linear">Project management: JIRA &amp; Linear</h2>
<p>I had previously been using JIRA to manage my tickets and things to do. I discovered Linear (I think because someone on <a href="https://www.relay.fm/radar">Under The Radar</a> mentioned it).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve completely switched to Linear for managing my tasks. I like it because:</p>
<ol>
<li>It has a native app, even if it&rsquo;s just an Electron wrapper, it feels surprisingly native</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s free (for me a one-person team)</li>
<li>Phenomenal keyboard shortcuts that let you move between tasks and screens, update and create tickets, and do all sorts.</li>
<li>Their idea of &ldquo;cycles&rdquo; fits almost perfectly with how I want to think about software development. They&rsquo;re essentially four-week sprint-like phases. You pick a four week period, acknowledge what you can/not get done during that, and make sure things stay in scope.</li>
<li>Nice integration with GitHub - generating branch names for tickets and tracking their progress through PR to merge status. Even working as a one-person team, this helps me focus on &ldquo;one things at a time&rdquo;.</li>
</ol>
<p>Using Linear comes with a lot less friction than JIRA.</p>
<h2 id="scale-back-the-ui">Scale-back the UI</h2>
<p>I had a bloody massive Figma file with a whole bunch of screen prototypes and idea exploration. By the time I had spent four weeks doing more code-heavy tasks I had lost track of what was where, what I liked and didn&rsquo;t like. There was too much in the Figma file and things were too hard to find.</p>
<p>So I copy-pasted everything into an &ldquo;archive&rdquo; tab in the file, and largely started from scratch. I used a more simple and iOS-like design. It&rsquo;s a lot more boring, yes - but it&rsquo;s also a lot more achievable.</p>
<p>Every now and then I go back to the archive and look to see if I had any interesting UI ideas, bits of data, or conventions that I&rsquo;d like. In general however I am trying to stick to a <em>very</em> simple and limited UI. No fiddly bits or tricky bits, I want to get something out there.</p>
<p>I have started this process of redesign, and it&rsquo;ll continue into Cycle#02. The UI I have in the app at the moment is&hellip; not good or consistent, but it is functional for testing. So I need to improve it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve become a lot more involved and aware of the iOS-specific design scene. Reading a lot of app reviews and listening to podcasts so I can get a better sense of &ldquo;what makes a well-designed app&rdquo;.</p>
<h2 id="make-the-ui-nice">Make the UI Nice</h2>
<p>I wanted to have a fully redesigned and implemented UI by the end of this cycle. That did not happen, I had other things to do. I&rsquo;m working on it though.</p>
<h2 id="continue-tdd">Continue TDD</h2>
<p>I wanted to continue to develop with tests are the forefront, however the severe refactoring and reorganisation I&rsquo;ve done have left a lot of my old tests useless, and I decided to move with greater speed by not having as many tests before I commit code.</p>
<p>This decision will come back to bite me, I&rsquo;m sure, but I want to focus on producing something usable and interactable. The code is not the message, the code is the vehicle.</p>
