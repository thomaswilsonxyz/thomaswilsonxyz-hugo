			<p>I’m currently designing and building the lexicon, ambitiously explained as “the most useful language learning resources in the world”.</p>
<p>The problem is that there’s a lot involved in that, you know? There’s theoretical questions like “what does most useful mean?” and “how do humans learn languages”?</p>
<p>Then there’s small problems like “what is the shape of the JSON I send to the client?” and “how do I generate prompts &amp; questions for language learning?”.</p>
<p>I’ve been thinking about these problems, in some capacity, for legitimately years. So it’s no wonder that I come to them with so much gusto.</p>
<p>A lot of the questions are nebulous. “Best” is subjective, and learning is a spectrum. Proposing theories and ideas is okay, but making something and finding out is even better.</p>
<p>The questions are big, and important to me, and so I don’t want an imperfect solution. The tech has to scale, the processes have to be automated, everything has to be <em>just so</em>. I’m building tools for problems I haven’t encountered but know I will encounter. Or would encounter, if I just got on with the work.</p>
<p>Problem solving is fractal. Every step you propose to get from A to B has a whole subset of steps if you look at it closely. If you’re not careful it goes from A -&gt; B, to A1 -&gt; A2, to A1.i -&gt; A1.ii.</p>
<p>It’s like how [the coastline has theoretically infinite length].</p>
<p>What I’m saying is that this week I challenged myself: no code, just design. Just product problems and questions. No infinite coastlines, no cartography.</p>
<p>So I made some designs. They’re down below. This is what happens when I ask the question “what could the future of language education <em>actually</em> look like” and then demand a concrete answer from myself.</p>
