<li><strong>This missed opportunity to name something</strong>: Ping Pong is a weird name for a sport, right? Ping Pong is actually a trademarked name, but it&rsquo;s not uncommon to call a thing by a brand name: it&rsquo;s like Hoover vs. Vacuum Cleaner, or Kleenex vs. Tissue. The real-fun fact here is that in 1900 Slazenger, a sports company, filed a trademark for the term Whiff-Waff - and 120 years laters (somehow) <em>Ping Pong</em> prevailed while <em>Whiff-Waff</em> died out, despite the fact that it&rsquo;s clearly more joyful. (<a href="https://www.worldwidewords.org/topicalwords/tp-whi1.htm">link to an oddly self-righteous article</a>).</li>
<li><strong>This stone man</strong>: The Apennine Colossus (<a href="https://unusualplaces.org/the-appennine-colossus/">link</a>) is a stone sculpture in Tuscany, Italy, which is a personification (embodiment?) of the Apennine mountain region. This is why he&rsquo;s really big, but also I guess why he&rsquo;s made of stone? The use of stone to represent stone is perhaps a little on-the-nose, but the piece is gorgeous and captivating.It was created in the late 1500s by a Flemish sculptor residing in Florence, and some people argue that if it placed in the Piazza della Signora (and not in the private garden of a Medici home some seven miles from Florence) it would be considered a masterpiece.</li>
<li><strong>This new word</strong>: <em>Farrago</em> means some kind of confused, haphazard, or disorganised mix - a word around which I appear to have been building a life philosophy.</li>
<li><strong>This set of tarot cards</strong>: Don&rsquo;t ask how I got here, but this week I learned one can purchase a Hello Kitty themed set of tarot cards for a cool £250 (<a href="https://www.etsy.com/uk/listing/637754503/last-day-70-off-and-free-shipping">etsy link</a>)</li>
<li><strong>This medical condition</strong>: Stendhal Condition, named after a French novelist, is characterised by dizziness, hallucinations, and heart palpitations which come on after being overwhelmed by the beauty of art. Amazingly, that means it&rsquo;s really common in Florence, Italy (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2991758/">link</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="cool-articles">Cool Articles</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>What to talk about in 1:1s</strong> by Julia Evans on her <a href="https://wizardzines.com/comics/1-1s/"><em>wizard zines</em></a> site. I really like the simplicity of this piece - it&rsquo;s just a collection of example things you might want to raise to a manager, so that 1:1s can actually be useful to you in the 6-12 month time span, and not just a box to tick, or reason to spend time away from your desk.</li>
<li><strong>Against Waldenponding</strong> by Venkatesh Rao on their <a href="https://breakingsmart.substack.com/p/against-waldenponding"><em>Breaking Smart</em></a> newsletter. No one is quite sure on the effects of so much technology, content, and mediums (podcast, YouTube video, Netflix, Newsletter) on our brain. It&rsquo;s given rise to a counter-culture, which is almost a meme in some tech circles, where someone voluntarily completely disconnects and go to live in a cabin in the woods. This article argues against, and while I don&rsquo;t necessarily agree with all the points the author makes, I think it&rsquo;s an interesting counter point in a debate where I rarely see someone taking an opposing side.</li>

<h2 id="what-ive-had-on-rotation">What I&rsquo;ve had on Rotation</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Something New</strong>: <em>Pink Elephant</em>, by Stand Atlantic (Pop Punk). I adore pop-punk, and I think everybody should embrace their inner teenager. This album is cathartic and comfortably pop-punk, but even better than that, it&rsquo;s a great album in its own right - it doesn&rsquo;t rely on nostalgia or tropes. Put it on play and relive the vibrancy of being 17-19 again. (<a href="https://songwhip.com/stand-atlantic/pink-elephant">links</a>).</li>
<li><strong>Something Old</strong>: <em>Safe in the Steep Cliffs</em> by Emancipator (Contemporary Instrumental). I&rsquo;ve spent a lot of time this week needing music without words, and I&rsquo;ve been rediscovering a lot of my old favourites during my time at University. The tempo and beat of this album is great to head-bop to while you&rsquo;re in a flow state, but perhaps a little too-high energy of more cognitively intense tasks (<a href="https://songwhip.com/emancipator/safe-in-the-steep-cliffs">links</a>)</li>

<li><a href="https://mailchimp.com/presents/by-the-books/">By the Books</a> - it&rsquo;s like the online experience of browsing a friend&rsquo;s bookshelf, but online. Created / curated by MailChimp.</li>
<li><a href="https://blobs.app/">blobs.app</a> - soft and gooey blobs are becoming more commonplace in UI design. This little web UI will generate a simple svg (or Flutter) blob for you to use. I got this from the Smashing Magazine newsletter,</li>
