<p>Summer has always been a time for <em>doing</em> and living. It doesn&rsquo;t feel right to force at least one piece of writing out of my brain every week. Discipline and routine are useful tools for living, but so is taking a summer break. I&rsquo;m going out of office for the next couple of months, so I can focus on the latter. I want long cycles, solitary train rides, food eaten outdoors, and adventure. This is what summer is for.</p>
<p>So there will be less writing in public, and more living in private for a little while. It&rsquo;s been a weird 18 months with a pandemic, but this year I feel I can have a more &ldquo;normal&rdquo; summer. So I&rsquo;m going to do that. Shame that I won&rsquo;t be going to Florence, though.</p>
<p>Take care and stay safe, I&rsquo;ll be back when the days start drawing in ✌️</p>
