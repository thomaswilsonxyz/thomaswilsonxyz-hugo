<p>The Weekly is a series of essays where I write on something I&rsquo;ve been thinking about over the last seven days. They&rsquo;re under a thousand words. There&rsquo;s some stuff going on in my professional life (positive stuff, but still stuff, you know?) so it&rsquo;s going to be a short one this week. It&rsquo;s better to publish than not.</p>
<p>I want to talk about old stories. I mean things that people have been experiencing for thousands or tens or thousands of years. I take a <em>lot</em> of joy from realising when I&rsquo;m seeing, or involved in, and old story.</p>
<p>There are some cliché old stories: sitting around a campfire, the smell of freshly cooked bread, hearing somebody sing or read a story out loud. There&rsquo;s a chance that literally everybody in your family tree for the last one hundred (or two hundred) generations has experienced these things. If humanity makes it another one hundred generations, they&rsquo;ll probably experience them too. These things are old stories.</p>
<p>I take a special kind of joy in realising that I&rsquo;m in the middle on an old story. Let me give an example. A few weeks ago my company held their Christmas/Summer party (lockdown had us delayed). We all got on a boat, and went up and then down the Thames for a bit. While on the boat, some people got a little too familiar with the bar. Some people got too drunk on a boat.</p>
<p>People getting a little too drunk on a boat: old story.</p>
<p>Watching somebody sweep the dust from their shop floor out on to the street: old story.</p>
<p>Picking blackberries off the plant while passing by: old story.</p>
<p>Noticing the summer solstice: old story.</p>
<p>Old stories make the world feel richer to me. They bring me closer to the human experience, and away from the personal experience. They make me feel like I&rsquo;m a part of something, and humbled. We&rsquo;ve come really far in the last one hundred years, but some things have been the same for the past couple of thousand. And they&rsquo;ll stay the same. We&rsquo;re all still people.</p>
<p>Try and keep an eye out for old stories, they&rsquo;re fun.</p>
