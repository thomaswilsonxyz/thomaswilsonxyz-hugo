<ul>
<li><strong>This thing about how we sleep</strong>: In Western Europe, about 35% of young adults sleep with a soft toy every night, and about 44% of people keep hold of their childhood soft toy. It can be especially helpful for people with low self-esteem, or higher anxiety to sleep with a soft toy, apparently. As someone who&rsquo;s kept firm tabs on their childhood bear (though I&rsquo;d say we sleep adjacent, not together), it shocks me that over half of people would throw their teddybear away. (<a href=https://www.theguardian.com/global/2020/jan/05/bears-lifeline-adults-who-sleep-with-soft-toys>source</a>).</li>
<li><strong>This older-than-expected coffee machine</strong>: The Nespresso capsule, those little pods of coffee grounds that you put in the coffee machines to get a single serving of espresso-based coffee, was initially invented 40 years ago by a rocket scientist. Eric Favre came up with the idea in the 1970s while in Rome, when he saw how one cafe in particular (Caffe Sant&rsquo;Eustachio, if you&rsquo;re curious) was more popular than all the others around it. He noticed that the baristas would aerate the coffee, and extract it for longer under higher pressures - to give it a stronger flavour, and more <em>crema</em>. In 1986 Nestle released the first version of the Nespresso machine and capsules to the public, but it took a while to take off, because the public didn&rsquo;t want it - they were happy with their instant coffee (can you imagine being happy with instant coffee?). It took 30 years, but the brand is now worth over $4 billion.</li>
<li><strong>This children&rsquo;s book author</strong>: In the late 20th Century, a 13 year-old Walter Crane was apprenticed to a master woodcarver-cum-political-activist (us millennials think we own the &ldquo;slash&rdquo; in occupations and side hustles). Crane got involved in the Arts and Crafts movement, which held that art has the power to educate and inform tastes, and also that &ldquo;art&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t just mean paintings - rather it means anything crafted. Arts and Crafts' most recognisable output is probably William Morris' floral patterns. Crane took a special interest in <em>Toy Books</em> - i.e. those made for young children learning to read. In 1899, in his 20s, Crane illustrated <em>Steps to Reading</em>, which was written by Nellie Dale. Dale was a teacher who pioneered a new (at the time) method of teaching children to read: pairing of words with pictures to convey the same meaning. When you write &ldquo;Jack plays cricket&rdquo; - you pair it with a nice illustration of a young boy (probably called Jack) playing cricket. At the time, most other books took a phonetic approach: showing each letter and having children say the letters out loud. Crane&rsquo;s illustrations, and understanding of the required manufacturing process (wood engraving apprenticeship, remember?), produced delightful and detailed illustrations for Dane&rsquo;s book, which caused them to remain popular long after more refined teaching methods were discovered. I would highly recommend checking out the images in the <a href=https://blog.nationalarchives.gov.uk/the-art-of-learning-to-read-with-walter-crane/>source</a>.</li>

<h2 id=what-ive-had-on-rotation>What I&rsquo;ve had on Rotation</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Something New</strong>: <em>Zephyrus</em> by The Old Hellos (Folk). I&rsquo;ve mentioned this band before, and for good reason. I love their riotous folk vibes, which they&rsquo;ve still managed to create during 2020. True, a year full of actual riots, but also a year full of not gathering in groups. (<a href=https://songwhip.com/the-oh-hellos/zephyrus>links</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Something Old</strong>: <em>Animal Magic</em> by Bonobo (Instrumental/House). Bonobo&rsquo;s come a long way in the production of his music - his newer music feels so clean and refined, but I&rsquo;ve enjoyed rediscovering the simple/rawer sound of his older stuff this week. It&rsquo;s still beat-centric, makes you want to move, and doesn&rsquo;t quite fit in any genre. (<a href=https://songwhip.com/bonobo/animal-magic>links</a>)</li>

<h2 id=cool-articles>Cool Articles</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href=https://www.theverge.com/2015/2/23/8069825/everything-i-know-about-a-good-death-i-learned-from-my-cat>Everything I know about a good death, I learned from my cat</a> by Elizabeth Lopatto for <em>The Verge</em>. For a while now I&rsquo;ve been thinking about dignity in dying, and this article is a really great exploration of some of those ideas, but in the context of Dorothy Parker, a cat with cancer. It&rsquo;s a touching article, with some well written points.</li>
