<li><strong>This useful thinking tool</strong>: good writing starts with observations, and moves to analysis. Making the transition is difficult. One way to spot a mental crutch is to see where you reach for words like &ldquo;interestingly&rdquo;, &ldquo;surprisingly&rdquo;, or &ldquo;notably&rdquo;. These all <em>hint</em> at a significance or meaningfulness, but don&rsquo;t actually clarify it. (<a href=https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/literature/21l-001-foundations-of-western-culture-homer-to-dante-fall-2008/writing-resources/obser_ver_anlsis.pdf>source</a>)</li>
<li><strong>This hot takeaway</strong>: Did you know that during the 1970s if you ordered a takeaway coffee it came in a styrofoam cup and a lid without a hole. If you wanted to drink your beverage, you had to take the lid off <em>and then put it back on</em> - can you imagine? Obviously impatient, the hardcore mobile coffee drinkers (think: taxi drivers) kept ripping holes in the lid to drink their Joe on the Go. Where there&rsquo;s demand, there&rsquo;s business and thus was born a <a href=https://designobserver.com/feature/coffee-lids-peel-pinch-pucker-puncture/39790/>whole field of design</a> for designing the most safe and ergonomic way to drink coffee from a cup without having to actually take the lid off.</li>
<li><strong>This Frank etymology</strong>: &ldquo;Lingua Franca&rdquo; describes a common language between a group of people. It emerged in the late 1700s and translates functionally as &ldquo;Language of the Franks&rdquo;, with <em>Franks</em> being anyone broadly from Westen Europe. The original Lingua Franca was a mixture of simplified Italian, Greek, Old French, Portuguese, Occitan (a Romance language spoken around southern France and northern Italy and Spain - <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occitan_language>wiki</a>) , Spanish, Arabic, and Turkish (<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lingua_franca#Etymology>source</a>)</li>
<li><strong>These Kinswomen</strong>: King James II had a thing for witty, plain looking mistresses. Two such mistresses were <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabella_Churchill_(royal_mistress)>Arabella Churchill</a> and <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_Sedley,_Countess_of_Dorchester>Catherine Sedley</a>. Arabella is described in <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=GfQ_TquTZicC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA30#v=onepage&q&f=false">The Ladies Dictionary (1694)</a> as being &ldquo;of no less Eminence for learning and ingenuous Parts than her Quality&mldr; she had a great facility in poetry and was a celebrated conversant among the Muses&rdquo;. Despite carrying four children for the man, she was later replaced by 16 year-old (yep) Catherine Sedley, who <a href=https://archive.org/details/sexwithkings500y00herm/page/52/mode/2up>remarked</a> of being chosen that &ldquo;It cannot be my beauty, for he must see I have none&mldr; and it cannot be my wit, for he has not enough to know I have any&rdquo;. James, buddy - you did not deserve these women.</li>
