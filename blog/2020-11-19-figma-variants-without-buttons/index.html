<h1 class=title>Introducing Figma Variants with 5 Components that aren't Buttons</h1>

<p>Figma recently introduced Variants - a way of extending and varying your components. Components in Figma, and in modern web development, are reusable and encapsulated elements of a design - with the classic examples of a Button or a Card.</p>
<p>Variants add new flexibility, and utility, to components in Figma by introducing properties and values to them in a programmatic way. If you have experience writing modern web applications, these variants and properties are like a specific subset of props which you pass to a component. I say subset, because some things will still need to be manually edited within an instance of a component - like the text in a card. Other things, like a &ldquo;variant&rdquo; or &ldquo;type&rdquo; be be edited (e.g. <code>info</code>, <code>danger</code>, or <code>primary</code>) which in turn could switch the accent colour, and the icon used (from an <em>i</em>, to an <em>alert</em>, to a <em>logo</em>). Think about all the common variations of a component you make for different use cases - variants are a way to define those before you come to use them.</p>
<p>Variants were released relatively recently, and I think they&rsquo;re cool. While they require more conscious work to create, they make it much easier to compose a mockup or design using an existing design system. Additionally, the need to create a set of names for both your properties, and their possible values, forces you to develop a verbal language around your design.</p>
<p>In this piece I&rsquo;m going to give five examples of where variants have helped me, in the last couple of weeks. I&rsquo;m not going to use the Button component as an example - because that&rsquo;s a tired workhorse, and I&rsquo;m definitely a bit sick of it.</p>
<h2 id=component-examples>Component Examples</h2>
<p>Don&rsquo;t bury the lead, here are some components to show how variants in Figma can be used. None of the are Buttons (did I mention that?), but they are all components I&rsquo;ve used in the past couple of weeks. Where I didn&rsquo;t make the component myself I&rsquo;ve linked out to the original author.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve standardised on <strong>Variant</strong> as a property name for a generic &ldquo;type&rdquo;, &ldquo;context&rdquo;, &ldquo;kind&rdquo;, or &ldquo;variety&rdquo; in components. This is the same language as <a href=https://material-ui.com/>Material UI</a> uses to describe this property and variation. I personally don&rsquo;t like to use <code>Type</code> - because it&rsquo;s already a word loaded with meaning in typed language. <code>Context</code> also has a meaning in React. Naming these kinds of properties is hard, but you have to stay consistent.</p>
<p>Shoutout to <a href=https://www.uiguideline.com/components>UI Guideline</a> for providing inspiration and starting points.</p>
<h3 id=1-toast>#1: Toast</h3>
<p>Toasts are those little alerts that pop up or down into a screen with a transient messages. Often you want to vary the accent colour, or icon, depending on the context of the message. There&rsquo;s only one property here (<code>Cariant</code>) which controls this accent colour.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Variant</code>: success, warning, danger, info</li>
</ul>
<p><img src=/blog-images/2020-11-18-component-0-toast.png alt="An illustration of of the toast component"></p>
<h3 id=2-note-or-comment>#2: Note or comment</h3>
<p><a href=http://eduard.io>Eduard Gim√©nez</a> released a set of comment components into the Figma Community. The <a href=https://www.figma.com/community/file/905932037239721740>Note This</a> file contains a set of sticky-note-like component which teams can use to annotate their designs in Figma.</p>
<p>Eduard has used two properties on his variants: <code>Color</code>, which describes the accent colour of the icon and top of the note, and <code>Dark</code> which is a boolean for if the note should be in a dark mode.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Color</code>: Yellow, Peach, Coral, etc.</li>
<li><code>Dark</code>: true, false</li>
</ul>
<p><img src=/blog-images/2020-11-18-component-1-note.png alt="An illustration of of the note component"></p>
<h3 id=3-calendar-day>#3: Calendar Day</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve recently been using the <a href=https://eva.design/>Eva Design System</a> as the starting point for a design language. As part of this, I&rsquo;ve been working with calendars and date pickers - which have turned out to be a classic example of hidden complexity.</p>
<p>Calendar days represent a single day within a week or month view, often used in the date-picker component.</p>
<p>Eva broke them down across three properties, each a boolean flag:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Selected</code>: true, false. Used to show if the day has been selected by the user (or by default), and is indicated with the box surrounding the day.</li>
<li><code>Has events</code>: true, false. Indicates if there are additional details, events, or context on a specific day. Visually this is represented by the small dot underneath the number.</li>
<li><code>Disabled</code>: true, false. Let the user know that the day cannot be selected or clicked. Visually greys out the day and reduces contrast between background, border, and content.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src=/blog-images/2020-11-18-component-3-calendar-day.png alt="An illustration of of the calendar day component"></p>
<h3 id=4-card-or-modal>#4: Card or Modal</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been building a number of screens and modals recently (as part of my design work at <a href=https://www.oxwash.com/>Oxwash</a>), and Variants have let me use a common component as the background on each of these instances.</p>
<p>The Card component typically represents the background and container for some content, e.g. a product in a product list. A Modal, however, is normally overlaid on the screen, as if it had a higher Z axis value (i.e. it pops out of the screen). Visually they are very similar, but conceptually they are quite different.</p>
<p>I found by adding or removing an icon in the top-right (e.g. to close a modal) - both were pretty much identical.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Platform</code>: mobile, desktop. Depending on the size of the viewport, you may wish to change padding, but also reduce/increase the size of touch targets.</li>
<li><code>With Button</code>: true, false. Place a button in the bottom right of the card, for a primary action.</li>
<li><code>With Close Button</code>: true, false. Place an icon in the top right of the card which acts as a touch target to close a modal.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src=/blog-images/2020-11-18-component-4-card.png alt="An illustration of of the card or modal component"></p>
<h3 id=5-tooltip>#5: Tooltip</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also been using Tooltips at Oxwash - tooltips are little containers of text that appear on hover (or tap, for mobile) to offer some additional information.</p>
<p>Technically, tooltips are quite complex, but in terms of design I&rsquo;ve kept them simple, with just a couple of properties:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Colour</code>: light, dark. To switch between a global light or dark mode UI.</li>
<li><code>Anchor Position</code>: bottom left, bottom right, etc. Which indicates where the little speech bubble anchor appears on the tooltip.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src=/blog-images/2020-11-18-component-5-tooltip.png alt="An illustration of of the tooltip component"></p>
<h2 id=wait-couldnt-figma-do-that-before>Wait, couldn&rsquo;t Figma do that before?</h2>
<p>Erm, yeah, sorta? Previously you could use naming conventions of components to help organise related components and then swap them out with siblings/cousins/grandparents. You did this with the naming conventions of the component, e.g. you could organise your three different types of <code>alert</code> component by calling them:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>alert/warning</code></li>
<li><code>alert/info</code></li>
<li><code>alert/success</code></li>
</ul>
<p>This works when you&rsquo;ve only got a couple of variations of a component. Specifically it works when your components only vary along one dimension, e.g. the accent colour of the alert. What happens when we have a couple of aspects the component can vary by? What if we want different components for mobile, for dark mode, for actionable alerts (e.g. with a button or link)?</p>
<p>All we&rsquo;ve got is a single string, so we absolutely have to i) maintain <strong>strict naming conventions</strong> of both the possible values of a property, and ii) <strong>identical order of properties</strong> in those strings. For example, the following components both parse well to a human, but would be structured very differently within figma:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>alert/mobile/warning/dark/withButton</code></li>
<li><code>alert/dark/noButton/warning/mobile</code></li>
</ul>
<p>This would make it hard to swap components out with the related ones. Figma essentially creates a directory, or folder, -esque structure so these kinds of inconsistencies eventually force you to move around a lot, or do a lot of searching. <strong>This will also make your components less discoverable</strong>, which is essential if you&rsquo;re a design team who shares Figma files to a wider organisation.</p>
<p>Also it&rsquo;s just messy. I don&rsquo;t like non-productive mess.</p>
<h2 id=properties-i-have-found-useful>Properties I have found useful</h2>
<p>There are a couple of properties I have found myself reaching for, and finding useful - especially when you&rsquo;re trying to work out all the fiddly details in a specific design. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Variant</strong>: Inspired by the material UI naming convention, this covers the possible contexts the component can appear in (<code>info</code>, <code>danger</code>, <code>warning</code>, <code>success</code>).</li>
<li><strong>Platform</strong>: If you&rsquo;re designing the same screen across platforms and viewports you may need to adjust touch targets and font sizes (<code>mobile</code>, <code>tablet</code>, <code>desktop</code>)</li>
<li><strong>Errored</strong>: If you&rsquo;re dealing with fields, forms, or processes - it&rsquo;s useful to know how we display a failure state and the related info (<code>true</code> or <code>false</code>)</li>
<li><strong>Disabled</strong>: Useful if you&rsquo;re trying to show a certain form state is invalid, most commonly applied to Buttons (<code>true</code> or <code>false</code>)</li>
<li><strong>Authenticated status</strong>: Who is the current user and what is their relationship to the page/component? Sometimes we want to show/hide certain actions depending on the authentication or authorisation status (<code>user</code>, <code>admin</code>, or <code>no-user</code>)</li>
</ul>
