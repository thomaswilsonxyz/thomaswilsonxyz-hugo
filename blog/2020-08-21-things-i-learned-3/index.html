<ul>
<li><strong>This medieval lingo</strong>: Have you ever wondered how to refer to the area where a good-old-fashioned joust took place? You know, jousts? Two men, two horses, two giant poles, and one film where Heath Ledger is irresponsibly handsome? Sorry, I got distracted there - did you know the area where the jousts took places is called a <em>List</em>, and the fence that separated the two riders is called the <em>Tilt</em> (<a href=http://www.lordsandladies.org/jousting-terminology.htm>source</a>). Initially it seemed a little wild to me that people ever jousted without the tilt, seems a little bit like unnecessary risk but that seems a little like mopping up the seawater as the Titanic sinks.</li>
<li><strong>This unusual payment</strong>: Between the 12th and 19th centuries there was a menagerie at the Tower of London. Around the 17th century, if you didn&rsquo;t fancy paying the three half-pence entrance fee, you could bring a cat or a dog - which was presumably used for food. <a href=https://www.thevintagenews.com/2018/03/03/18th-century-zoo/>source</a></li>
<li><strong>This new word</strong>: <em><a href=https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/heterodox>Heterodox</a></em> or <em>Heterodoxy</em>, meaning a belief which deviates from some norm or convention, but not enough to be unorthodox or unorthodoxy.</li>
<li><strong>This Minoan jewellery</strong>: About three-four thousand years ago, the Minoans created some <a href=https://culturetaste.com/blog/45_minoan-malia-bees-history-symbolism.html>incredible</a> <a href=https://www.ancient.eu/image/885/minoan-bee-pendant/>bee</a> jewellery. Created around 1800-1700 BE by the Minoans in what is now Crete, the Bees were symbols of nature/earth, with honey being used in holy rituals by the culture. I&rsquo;m amazed that humans made those so long ago, and that they survive until today to be seen.</li>

<h2 id=things-ive-had-on-rotation>Things I&rsquo;ve had on rotation</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Something new</strong>: <em>Broken Access</em> by Theo Alexander (2020). The spacious, elegant classical tones of this piece make it a joy to drift off to and come back to. (<a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/2WN5bFYGFunOS7AMGZbmgI?si=dc3ZldZTSZ-r30TMLG4tYQ">Spotify</a>, <a href=https://music.apple.com/gb/album/broken-access/1513480825>Apple Music</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Something old</strong>: <em>Camp</em> by Childish Gambino (2011). While I&rsquo;m glad that Childish Gambino has evolved into what he is, the mixtape, hype, and always-woke vibes of old Gambino are what you need sometimes. (<a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/4yE6WFFun0KjJXbdWkoVrp?si=ZpWDgL4YSz2gTgCg5RYbLQ">Spotify</a>, <a href=https://geo.music.apple.com/us/album/camp/1450829373>Apple Music</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=cool-things>Cool things:</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href=https://screenshot.rocks/>screenshot.rocks</a> - Create nice little screenshot mockups in your browser. Found this on <a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev>r/webdev</a>.</li>
<li><a href=https://arwes.dev/>Arwes.dev</a> - A futuristic sci-fi and cyberpunk GUI. I love me some retro-future aesthetic. Found this <em>everywhere</em> because people kept sharing it.</li>
