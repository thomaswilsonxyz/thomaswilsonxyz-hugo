Here are some of those moments:
 Moved to Oxford and filled a moderate-sized house with an unwise number of plants Climbed Helvellyn and Haystacks in the Lake District Ate food outside with friends Ate food inside with family Watched campfires Drank gin on hot evenings and cold nights from between clinking ice and wedges of citrus Cycled through sunny mornings and afternoons  ">
