<p><strong>tl;dr</strong> - I have moved the writing I have created on my experiences with eating disorders to this site (and off of Medium.). You can find them <a href=/eating-anthology>here</a>.</p>
<p>For at least the past five years, my mental health has been affected through and alongside a weird relationship with food, exercise, and eating. I find writing helps me clarify my thoughts and my situation to me. While a lot of this writing is intentionally private, there are a couple of piece I want to be publicly available.</p>
<p>Back when I published my first piece on this subject, I put it on medium.com - however that site has recently favoured the advertiser over the reader. Back in 2016 it was very much the opposite, and while I understand they need to make money from people reading their writing - I don&rsquo;t, and so I can afford to favour the reader experience. When I&rsquo;ve written something so personal and meaningful, I wanted people to read it in the same way.</p>
<p>So I have collated my writing into a small anthology, which you can find on my personal site, <a href=/eating-anthology>here</a> or each piece individually at:</p>
<ul>
<li>2016: <a href=/eating-anthology/2016>My Eating Disorder Was Dangerous Because It Was Powerful</a></li>
<li>2017: <a href=/eating-anthology/2017>Loss and my ED</a></li>
<li>2020: <a href=/eating-anthology/2020>My eating disorder will always remind me of the person I was, and am</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;ve left the initial pieces as untouched - with only some minor styling changes to bring some of the long lyrics I mention into life.</p>
