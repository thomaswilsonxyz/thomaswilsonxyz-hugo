<p>Hello. I&rsquo;m building an app called Dash Dot, it&rsquo;s a native iOS app for interval training that is a) well-designed, and b) privacy- and utility-focused. This post covers the first (approx.) six weeks in designing and building the app.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never made a truly native app before (I have written things in React Native before, though), nor have I ever successfully released a product to the world. Maybe this will be the time ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</p>
<p>I want to #buildinpublic so this is a proto-changelog for a product that I&rsquo;m hopeful will exist one day.</p>
<p><strong>Cycle?</strong> I don&rsquo;t like the &ldquo;sprint&rdquo; terminology that agile practices use to describe how features are developed. Nobody sprints all the time, that&rsquo;s ridiculous, and building a product is a long slow burn. Also, I don&rsquo;t have a product to iterate on, I&rsquo;m currently working forwards from &ldquo;wouldn&rsquo;t this be a good idea&rdquo;. I need longer than two-week springs to make a difference. In line with Basecamp&rsquo;s six-week &ldquo;bets&rdquo; and Linear&rsquo;s &ldquo;cycles&rdquo;, I want to work in <em>cycles</em>, as in lunar cycle or life cycle: longer (six-ish) periods of work where I focus on broader goals.</p>
<p>This cycle (#0) lasted seven weeks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Started: 2021-02-01</li>
<li>Ended: 2021-03-21</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=what-do-i-have-right-now->What do I have right now ?</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>An idea</strong> of what I want to build, how it offers value, and a route to monetisation</li>
<li><strong>MVP Features</strong> that I want to build before I release (into Test Flight), and a rough shape for the functionality I want to add on after that.</li>
<li><strong>A very messy Figma file</strong> that needs tidying up but <em>does</em> contain screens for a lot of the app: dashboards, timers, config pages, profile pages.</li>
<li><strong>A working swift iOS app</strong> that lets you configure a timer and do some very primitive navigation</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=what-have-i-done-that-im-proud-of>What have I done that I&rsquo;m proud of?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Decided to make this app, don&rsquo;t overlook that</li>
<li>Learned a <em>whole</em> lot about Swift and iOS development. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d written any Swift code before 2021, and I&rsquo;ve spent the past four years building predominately frontend web software in JS/TS, so I&rsquo;m pretty proud of this.</li>
<li>Visually designed and prototyped the principle workflow for creating a timer, completing it, and viewing your account</li>
<li>Created code that travels the entire vertical stack (i.e. end-to-end) that allows a user to create, save, update, and delete a timer</li>
<li>Toyed with JIRA and Linear for project management</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=what-went-well>What went well?</h2>
<ul>
<li>I actually built something, I have an idea of the product and I have the first few screens that make this a little bit closer to a reality. That&rsquo;s a cool feeling</li>
<li>Rapid low and medium fidelity UI prototypes and iteration. I didn&rsquo;t waste too much time wanting to get the perfect UI done before I started, so I&rsquo;ve built with a very Spartan UI in Swift, but have worked in parallel in Figma to know what the content (if not the presentation and layout) of my screens will be.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m proud to be focusing on UX and UI that actually makes sense for humans. I tried a lot of competitor/existing interval timer apps and wow are they non-intuitive. They just expect you to poke around, do things without confirming them or making clear what they&rsquo;re about to do, and have unclear iconography and buttons. I&rsquo;m happy to be building and designing an app that takes these things seriously.</li>
<li>Early validation of the idea from discussing it with friends (which isn&rsquo;t real validation, I know)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=what-didnt-go-well>What didn&rsquo;t go well?</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>UI Design != software design</strong>. Although the two relate closely, I made the mistake of tying my initial software design to the UI/UX design. Although the two should be similar, they shouldn&rsquo;t be identical. I made my code too strict and tightly linked to the UI implementation. I have been working to combat this in more recent code design.</li>
<li><strong>Better code design</strong> I should make more effort to design systems on paper <em>before</em> I start coding, not code > get stuck > design > delete & rewrite code. Obviously, you can&rsquo;t just plan to the exclusion of coding, but you can spend 10-15 minutes getting your ideas on paper, yeah?</li>
<li><strong>TDD</strong>. Related heavily to the above: I tried to use test-driven development (TDD) from day 0, but it made it hard to prototype and change things. Maybe if I was a better engineer I would have designed a better system from the get-go, but my style of doing things is a little more &ldquo;let&rsquo;s see what happens if I do this&rdquo;. - I ended up designing and building one system, then splitting it out, dividing it, and re-naming parts which made my tests redundant and all fail, so I&rsquo;m basically going to have to go back and re-write tests for everything - This may not have been the best approach - slowly refactoring code and tests in parallel would probably have been a good idea, but I decided I&rsquo;d rather just go ahead and write the code instead. If this was an established app in production I would definitely have done code and tests together.</li>
<li><strong>Writing in a new language</strong>. I&rsquo;m having to learn about both Swift and iOS development <em>as</em> I construct the app itself, so there have been several sizable re-shuffles and re-architectures</li>
<li><strong>A messy Figma File that&rsquo;s hard to navigate</strong>. I haven&rsquo;t settled on a UI/UX design, there&rsquo;s been a lot of iteration - which means the business components exist but the UI components are <em>very</em> minimalist and industrial (read: bad)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=what-has-been-most-challenging>What has been most challenging?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Learning a new language (Swift) for the development</li>
<li>Learning and implementing the architectural patterns for iOS development (e.g. Model-View-View Model)</li>
<li>Having to learn the entire vertical stack before building a feature: persistence, animations, layout & styling, etc. The process feels a lot more like full-stack engineering than frontend, despite thinking otherwise as I went into this.</li>
<li>Shifting from the predominately functional style of building React applications to the more Object-Orientated way in Swift.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=what-do-i-do-next>What do I do next?</h2>
<p>In order, here are the things I want to do in the next cycle:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Finalise the current architecture and add tests</strong>: The code that lets you create and configure a timer is functional (it walks), but I can probably do some tidying. In fact I can definitely do some tidying. I absolutely want to have tests in my code, even if TDD didn&rsquo;t work out this time and I&rsquo;ve had to write code <em>then</em> tests, that&rsquo;s still preferable to writing no test.</li>
<li><strong>Solidify the design</strong>: I&rsquo;ve got a lot of possible UIs and medium-fidelity prototypes, with various colour schemes and mental/visual metaphors in my current Figma file, I need to settle on the Colour Palette & Design Tokens so that I can build consistent UIs. I need to get rid of old ideas (I&rsquo;ll probably move them to some kind of &lsquo;Archive&rsquo; part of the file so that I can go back to them later). This should create a consistent UI and UX across the various user journeys.</li>
<li><strong>Allow someone to complete a timer</strong>: Design the architecture and UI that would allow someone to select a timer they have made, and actually complete it</li>
<li><strong>Buy some domain names</strong>: I need to start thinking about the keywords and handles I&rsquo;ll be using online</li>
<li><strong>Decide on JIRA vs Linear</strong>: How to manage software development? What an ever-turning wheel</li>
</ol>
<p>Note the lack of marketing and advertising here? I&rsquo;m aware that this should start early but I don&rsquo;t want to do anything until I&rsquo;m sure that I&rsquo;ll have something that I&rsquo;d be happy letting someone else use.</p>
<p>Hopefully, Cycle #1 will last from now until the beginning of May 2021, but I also expect it could last longer. Right now it&rsquo;s about making ideas solid and building code - and that happens when it happens.</p>
