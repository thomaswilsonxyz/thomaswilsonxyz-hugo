<p><em>Tiny Thoughts</em> are little (&lt;500 word) essays. They&rsquo;re concise.</p>
<p>I make user interfaces, and I often participate in, or lead, the process of designing these interfaces. For a while I thought I wanted to transition fully into a design role. Ultimately I am drawn to the certainty and craft of engineering. However, the the mental models, sensibilities, and philosophies of design still appeal to me. I can like both, and businesses need both.</p>
<p>Separating design and engineering is a false dichotomy: design can benefit from the implementation-details of engineering; and engineering benefits from the non-linear and multi-faceted process of design thinking. It&rsquo;s symbiotic.</p>
<p>A while ago I got the chance to work in an environment where the two <em>were</em> separated. The design process and design thinking were both absent, and there was no appetite to bring them in.</p>
<p>During this time the mentality was to copy the UI of an existing, similar, already-successful product. A lot of people on the frontlines of tech have been told &ldquo;just copy company <em>X</em>&rdquo; where <em>X</em> is AirBNB, Twitter, LinkedIn, Pinterest, whatever. &ldquo;Just make the UI look like that&rdquo;.</p>
<p>At first glance, the thinking is sound: we don&rsquo;t have the money or time to invest in design, but this other company has. Let the whole design team over at Instagram/Reddit/Uber do the hard work, and we&rsquo;ll just steal from them.</p>
<p>At a personal level, I did not like working in this environment, because I felt alone. At a professional level, the working process was constrained, and the resulting software generic and left behind when the source material changed.</p>
<p>Some software has to be boring: I wouldn&rsquo;t want a whacky or zany bank app, menstrual cycle tracking app, government app, or crisis support app. There is a place for boring UI. Borings UI also removes a layer of difficulty in how the product is built. [^1: I would argue that it&rsquo;s not actually <em>that</em> much easier to build an app with a Boring UI - UI is just one part of any software.].</p>
<p>Behind a lot of boring UIs is a team of individuals who have thought an awful lot about their business, users, and problems. They have considered information architecture, interactions, users, and outcomes.</p>
<p>Just because the end result is boring, does not mean the process of designing it was short and simple.</p>
<p>When you copy <em>just</em> the final product, even a boring one, you diminish your entire business&rsquo;s ability to iterate, and any insight into the <em>why</em> of the UI are lost. You have limited your engineering team. Sometimes this limitation is significant (a client-facing product), sometimes it is not (an infrastructure service).</p>
<p>The product of engineering should not exist without the process of design. The discussions I have had, facilitated, and witnessed when deciding on UIs have made me a better engineer, and have made the product better.</p>
