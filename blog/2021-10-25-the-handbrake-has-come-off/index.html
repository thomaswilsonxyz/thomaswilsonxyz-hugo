<p>Over the past two months I have inherited leadership of an engineering team I have worked in for the last twelve months. In the last two weeks I&rsquo;ve seen the speed of development go from not-slow, to almost inarguably fast (given current resource constraints).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve spent months slowly attempting to unpick the parts of the team and company which were bottlenecks. There&rsquo;s actually some very interesting conversations around what makes a bottleneck, and how do you spot one. But I want to talk about the feeling of not moving fast, and then all of a sudden moving quickly.</p>
<p>The analogy I&rsquo;ve been giving is that it&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;m in a car facing down hill, and then the handbrake came off.</p>
<p>At first I was like <em>ahhhhhh!</em>, but now I&rsquo;m more like <em>ahhhh?</em>. Ya know?</p>
<p>For the year before this I had been a member of a very small engineering team, where I had written or reviewed 90% of the code that went into production. I, broadly, knew all of the projects, and what was happening.</p>
<p>Now, with a larger team (six) and some well-experienced hands in and incoming, things are starting to happen that I don&rsquo;t <em>fully</em> understand. Sure, I understand the what and the why, but the how isn&rsquo;t as in focus. I&rsquo;m a frontend engineer by trade, dev-ops is&mldr; <em>hand-wavy</em> it works?</p>
<p>This is the <em>ahhhhhhh!</em> moment. The fear that things are happening, decisions are being made, changes to passing, and I&rsquo;ve had full visibility on the result but far less on the process. And that scares me because what if things start going wrong?</p>
<p>I trust all the engineers in my team implicitly, you have to, but it&rsquo;s still scary. Things still go wrong.</p>
<p>And the <em>ahhhhh?</em> ? That came when I saw the cadence of our releases going up, the quality and security of our software being cemented (test-driven development and refactoring), and both deeper and wider features being shipped.</p>
<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s terrifying and I feel a little out of control, but it&rsquo;s been about two years since I&rsquo;ve felt like I&rsquo;m part of such a productive engineering organisation. It feels like the value proposition of engineering is apparent, not promised.</p>
<p>There are lot of parts to this improvement, including but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Test-driven development</strong> at unit, functional, and integration level</li>
<li><strong>A simple git workflow</strong> for <code>main</code> -> <code>feature</code> -> PR -> <code>main</code></li>
<li><strong>Pair programming</strong> for 10-50% of my day</li>
<li><strong>Feature-driven tickets</strong>, by moving to a monorepo and unifying development & deployment, engineers ship an entire (cross-cutting) feature all at once</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to talk in detail on each of these, but for now I&rsquo;ll just say that I am confident each of these highly correlate to better developer productivity.</p>
