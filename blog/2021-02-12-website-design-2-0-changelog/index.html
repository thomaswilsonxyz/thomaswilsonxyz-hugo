What&rsquo;s changed ?  New Dark theme colours: Look around. Look at this dark purply-grey. Look at the same brand-orange, and the deliciously crisp white text. New colours! 100% More Portfolio: I completely revamped the homepage so that it actually showcases my writing and my work. The content isn&rsquo;t hidden behind anything anymore. 50% Less Bio: I&rsquo;ve shortened bios and text on the home page, they made the site feel a lot more static and like a placeholder site than I wanted.">

<h2 id=whats-changed->What&rsquo;s changed ?</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>New Dark theme colours</strong>: Look around. Look at this dark purply-grey. Look at the same brand-orange, and the deliciously crisp white text. New colours!</li>
<li><strong>100% More Portfolio</strong>: I completely revamped the homepage so that it actually showcases my writing and my work. The content isn&rsquo;t hidden behind anything anymore.</li>
<li><strong>50% Less Bio</strong>: I&rsquo;ve shortened bios and text on the home page, they made the site feel a lot more static and like a placeholder site than I wanted.</li>
<li><strong>Blog Series Highlight</strong>: I&rsquo;ve highlighted, and made accessible, certain series on my blog (like my &ldquo;Things Week I Learned&rdquo; series). You can now filter for just these posts on the blog page.</li>
<li><strong>Personal Brand</strong>: The site sizzles a little bit more with personal brand and little &ldquo;moments&rdquo; in the UI. It&rsquo;s a &ldquo;website experience&rdquo;. This includes little self-aware UI labels which seem very post-modernist and bring me joy.</li>
<li><strong>Tags</strong>: I added tags to blog posts. They don&rsquo;t do anything right now though lol.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=yeah-but-how>Yeah but how?</h2>
<p>I bloody love talking about workflows and processes. By brevity here is a mercy and a kindness:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Design</strong>: Any and all visual design was done in <a href=https://www.figma.com/about/>Figma</a>. I bloody love Figma.</li>
<li><strong>Code</strong>: This site was, and remains, a static site built with <a href=https://www.gatsbyjs.org/>Gatsby</a> (and therefore on <a href=https://reactjs.org/>React</a> and <a href=https://graphql.org/>GraphQL</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Deployment</strong>: <a href=https://www.netlify.com/>Netlify</a>, and they do a <em>stunning</em> job.</li>
<li><strong>Writing</strong>: Everything is Markdown (<a href=https://thomaswilson.xyz/blog/2021-01-10-an-ode-to-plaintext-notes>markdown is cool</a>). I write with <a href=https://ia.net/writer>iA Writer</a> for longer pieces (like this) and <a href=https://ia.net/writer>Obsidian</a> for research and emergent writing.</li>
