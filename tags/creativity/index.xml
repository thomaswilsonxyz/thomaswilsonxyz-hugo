I first discovered their work in 2016, with the release of Let Them Eat Chaos - a conceptual spoken word album which imagines a London street at 4:18am. To be perfectly honestly I think Tempest has a well honed skill with words. Their work has spoken to me with clarity in times when not a lot else could get through. Some of Tempest&amp;rsquo;s phrases and lyrics are burned, deep, into my brain and emerge with remarkable frequency when I&amp;rsquo;m just trying to live my life.</description></item></channel></rss>
