Set on the River Thames in Oxford around the turn of the 20th century, it follows individuals and families as a girl is found not-quite-dead in the river. Everybody sees somebody different in this child, they see the lost daughter they wished they could re-find, or the lost sibling who died some thirty years ago. We follow the people of the village as they attempt to care for, claim stewardship over, and make counter-claims about her.</description></item></channel></rss>
