If you wanted to add some styles, you’d write them in a .css file and then &amp;lt;link rel=&amp;quot;stylesheet&amp;quot;&amp;gt; the two together. So you’d write your entire site in semantic HTML, about whatever it is people did back then (like mammoth hunting or pyramid building) and then you would ftp that onto your server, and other people could view it.</description></item></channel></rss>
