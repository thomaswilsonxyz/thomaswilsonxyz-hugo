The book makes very few references to William, and never actually names him. He is always &amp;ldquo;he&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;husband&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;father&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;him&amp;rdquo;. Describing Agnes as &amp;ldquo;the wife&amp;rdquo;, as I did mere sentences ago, serves only as an introduction, and as a drastic under-selling of Agnes.
Set in a 1500s southern England, the book darts between the characters' present - following the life and early death of Hamnet, Agnes' only son - and the years preceding these events: Agnes' childhood, meeting her husband, raising a family.</description></item><item><title>Queenie</title><link>https://www.thomaswilson.xyz/book-reviews/queenie/</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thomaswilson.xyz/book-reviews/queenie/</guid><description>Queenie is an excellent debut by Carty-William. The novel&amp;rsquo;s titular narrator pins you to the page - she has a strong and unique voice, yet also unreliable and unlikable at times. It takes you through something which feels both personal and also cultural: micro-aggressions, personal and collective trauma, mental health, and love and friendship in the early 21st century. It&amp;rsquo;s a really gripping and motivating work that Carty-Williams manages to end on a hopeful, if a little well-trodden, note.</description></item></channel></rss>
