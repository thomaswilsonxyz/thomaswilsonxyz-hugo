It is a “Why Bear suits my needs right now better than Notion” discussion. So there’s a little more nuance in my explanation. The crux of my point it is this: I am a scatter brained person who develops software, makes dance, and exercises semi-seriously - and I need a digital tool to help me manage my thoughts, writing, documentation, and general projects.</description></item></channel></rss>
