Will love this book again, because I know I&amp;rsquo;m going to read it again. And then probably again after that. Moran&amp;rsquo;s two hundred page treatise on the process of writing and re-writing is meatier than you would expect.

Moran shows you the importance of these questions, and the consequences of (not) adhering to them.</description></item><item><title>Tiny thought: Writing for recipe cards</title><link>https://www.thomaswilson.xyz/blog/2020-10-24-writing-for-recipe-cards/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thomaswilson.xyz/blog/2020-10-24-writing-for-recipe-cards/</guid><description>Tiny Thoughts are little (&amp;lt;500 word) essays. They&amp;rsquo;re concise.
I&amp;rsquo;ve spent the past three months consciously trying to write and read more. I want to improve my ability to refine and communicate thought, and doing it in public helps motivate me to produce work.
One of the hardest problems I find myself addressing frequently is my desire to over-explain or provide too much information. I have read many times that good writing is about being concise.</description></item></channel></rss>
