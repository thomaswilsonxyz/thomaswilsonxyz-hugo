Consigned to life as a bed slave for Achilles, she is later taken from Achilles by Agamemnon, which in turn causes Achilles to stop fighting for the Greeks. In the tradition of classic epic poems like the Iliad, women and slaves are treated entirely as property - not as humans.</description></item></channel></rss>
