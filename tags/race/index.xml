The novel&amp;rsquo;s titular narrator pins you to the page - she has a strong and unique voice, yet also unreliable and unlikable at times. It takes you through something which feels both personal and also cultural: micro-aggressions, personal and collective trauma, mental health, and love and friendship in the early 21st century. It&amp;rsquo;s a really gripping and motivating work that Carty-Williams manages to end on a hopeful, if a little well-trodden, note.</description></item></channel></rss>
