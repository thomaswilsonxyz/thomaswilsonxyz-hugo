I first discovered their work in 2016, with the release of Let Them Eat Chaos - a conceptual spoken word album which imagines a London street at 4:18am. To be perfectly honestly I think Tempest has a well honed skill with words. Their work has spoken to me with clarity in times when not a lot else could get through. Some of Tempest&amp;rsquo;s phrases and lyrics are burned, deep, into my brain and emerge with remarkable frequency when I&amp;rsquo;m just trying to live my life.</description></item><item><title>how do we know we're doing it right?</title><link>https://thomaswilson.xyz/book-reviews/how-do-we-know-were-doing-it-right/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://thomaswilson.xyz/book-reviews/how-do-we-know-were-doing-it-right/</guid><description>Sykes' collection of essays covers a surprisingly large amount of ground for a relatively short book.

How do we know we&amp;rsquo;re doing it right? clearly comes from a lot of careful conversations, introspection, and research but at times Sykes seems to lose herself under disjointed quotations of other peoples' words.</description></item><item><title>wow, no thank you</title><link>https://thomaswilson.xyz/book-reviews/wow-no-thank-you/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://thomaswilson.xyz/book-reviews/wow-no-thank-you/</guid><description>Samantha Irby came onto my radar in 2019 after a reading slump from that time I was burned out by my job in a VC startup. We are never meeting in real life, her previous set of essays published in 2017, was displayed prominently in a central London bookstore it was a) bright yellow, and b) covered in a picture of a hateful cat - so I started believing in destiny and bought the book, read the book, and adored it.</description></item></channel></rss>
