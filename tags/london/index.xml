It was gifted with the best of intentions: someone or other famous reported that it made them feel at home in London, a city I love. But a city that can feel indifferent to you. This book did not make me feel at home in this city. It showed how it is possible for a place to be the centre of art, politics, ambition and still allow anyone to shift un-affixed through their life.</description></item><item><title>Queenie</title><link>https://www.thomaswilson.xyz/book-reviews/queenie/</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thomaswilson.xyz/book-reviews/queenie/</guid><description>Queenie is an excellent debut by Carty-William. The novel&amp;rsquo;s titular narrator pins you to the page - she has a strong and unique voice, yet also unreliable and unlikable at times. It takes you through something which feels both personal and also cultural: micro-aggressions, personal and collective trauma, mental health, and love and friendship in the early 21st century. It&amp;rsquo;s a really gripping and motivating work that Carty-Williams manages to end on a hopeful, if a little well-trodden, note.</description></item></channel></rss>
