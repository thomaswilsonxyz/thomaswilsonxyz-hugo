This is a really good way to look at visual conventions that other people made, and have used in their UIs and UX.
If I were to examine the time I spent “designing” more closely, and divided it between actually pushing pixels around in Figma, and looking at other people’s work on Dribbble I would be shocked and ashamed.</description></item></channel></rss>
