Andy Weir books make you feel ready to don a lab coat. He writes books that are clearly well researched and very involved, but they’re still readable. Dan Brown gets (at most) one of these two things.
Project Hail Mary is inevitably going to be compared to Weir’s 2011 The Martian, a book which received (well deserved) critical and public acclaim.</description></item><item><title>An Absolutely Remarkable Thing</title><link>https://www.thomaswilson.xyz/book-reviews/an-absolutely-remarkable-thing/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.thomaswilson.xyz/book-reviews/an-absolutely-remarkable-thing/</guid><description>An Absolutely Remarkable Thing (AART; because I&amp;rsquo;m not paid by the word here) is a wonderful Sci-Fi(-ish) adventure by Hank Green, one of the content creators in the first wave of the YouTube-meets-mainstream movement. It&amp;rsquo;s a delightful first piece in his The Carls series, and even if the characters fall a little flat - the story is compelling enough to make this book a delightful and worthy read. Green&amp;rsquo;s obviously got a lot to say about the current state of internet, fame, media, and global attention.</description></item></channel></rss>
